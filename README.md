# LOT Benchmarks Results

This repository contains supplementary material for the paper 
[Smart Pointers and Shared Memory Synchronisation for Efficient Inter-process Communication in ROS on an Autonomous Vehicle](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.07085).

The full resolution pictures used throughout the paper can be found under the [figures](./figures) folder, whilst the 
underlying raw data is stored under the [data/core2](./data/core2) folder. The C++ source code is stored in [ros_comm](https://github.com/fiveai/ros_comm) repository on [lot branch](https://github.com/fiveai/ros_comm/tree/lot).

The configuration of each use case has been embedded into the name of the file, e.g. 
`sub1_shm_1p1s_same_docker_1024x1024_pool0_Hz30_count2000.txt` designates a test case where the SHM transport has been 
used to broadcast 2000 1MB images from one publisher to one subscriber at 30Hz without relying on memory pools.
